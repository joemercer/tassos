# TODO
________


- remove handlebars and precompilation from workflow
- - we'll let angular handle our templating

- begin structuring the angular app

- get data (card values) in json format
- store the data somewhere appropriate

- have a phonegap build test app that builds from the core source so that we can test on mobile easier (instead of having to actually release the entier app)

- add all the useful author metatags etc

- we're not using a css preprocessor, like LESS, which is kind of obnoxious


# Backlog
___________

- incorporate Tabletop.js for a "database"

- testing? ugh
